# Nuclei-Segmentation
This repository contains an implementation of Mask R-CNN algorithm using [Matterport library](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN)
for nuclei segmentation from whole slide images of tissue sections. 

Description: Nuclei segmentation using Mask R-CNN based on the ResNet 50 backbone.

This model was trained using data from our IEEE TMI paper and [MoNuSeg challenge](https://monuseg.grand-challenge.org/).
